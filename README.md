# OS_A1
In this assignment, i will write a Command Line Interpreter (CLI) for my operating system.
My CLI should allow the user to enter the input through the keyboard. After the
user writes the command and presses enter, the string is parsed, and the indicated
command executed.
The CLI will keep accepting different commands from the user until the user writes
“exit”, then the CLI terminates
If the user enters a wrong command or bad parameters (invalid path, file
instead of directory in certain commands, etc.), the program should print
some error messages without terminating
